# Creating a Bitcoin Paper Wallet

## 1. Generate a new Bitcoin address

To generate a new Bitcoin address, follow the instructions in the [README.md](README.md) file.

## 2. Receiving Bitcoin

To add some initial bitcoin to your wallet, purchase some bitcoin from a trusted exchange and send it to the public address generated in the previous step.

Note: This is very simple and can be done by anyone who has the public address. The secret key is not required.

Some services that support sending bitcoin to a public address include:

- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/wallet)
- [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)

## 3. Sending Bitcoin

To send bitcoin from your wallet, you will need to use a service that supports sending coins from one address to another, as well as the private key.

For example, you can install electrum on an internet connected computer and use it to send coins to another address by importing your wallet. Note once you do this, 
your bitcoin will now be considered "hot" and not as as secure as the cold paper wallet.

Other services that support sending coins from one address to another include:

- [Blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/en/wallet)
- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/wallet)
- [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)
